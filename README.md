# Sound-Analysis

The Sound Analysis course delivered by the university Politecnico di Milano provides tools for audio synthesis and rendering. For these projects, scripts were first provided with missing elements to guide us in the development of the signal processing. They have been made in group of two.

The first project topic is statistical audio processing. In this project, we aim to estimate the Room Impulse Response (RIR) of a small reverberant environment using Wiener filtering and Overlap and Add algorithm. The code can be found there : [Wiener_OLA](https://github.com/PalomaPerrin/Sound-Analysis/blob/main/Wiener_OLA.m)


The second project topic is microphone array signal processing. With this code, we want to define the direction of arrival (DOA) of two sources using two different algorithms : Sum and Delay Beaformer and MUSIC algorithms. The code can be found there : [DAS_MUSIC](https://github.com/PalomaPerrin/Sound-Analysis/blob/main/DAS_MUSIC.m)

All the data needed to run the codes is available along with the codes in the repository.
